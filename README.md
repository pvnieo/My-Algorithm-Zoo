# My-Algorithms-Zoo
Set of algorithms that I implemented for some random projects, either because I didn't find an implementation in the language I want, or because the implementation didn't suit me.

For the moment, the implemented algorithms are:
 - RPCA: Principal Component Pursuit algorithm for robust PCA
 - Learning rate finder: Leslie N. Smith's Learning rate finder method
